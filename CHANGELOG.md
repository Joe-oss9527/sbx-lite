## [2.1.0] - 2025-10-17

### üîê Security Fixes (CRITICAL)

#### Fixed Command Injection in Caddy Certificate Sync Hook
- **File**: `lib/caddy.sh`
- **Impact**: CRITICAL - Prevented potential command injection via domain parameter
- **Changes**:
  - Added strict domain validation before hook script creation (RFC 1035 compliant)
  - Implemented multi-layer validation: function entry + hook script execution
  - Added length validation (max 253 characters)
- **Details**: Domain parameter now validated with regex `^[a-z0-9]([a-z0-9-]{0,61}[a-z0-9])?(\.[a-z0-9]([a-z0-9-]{0,61}[a-z0-9])?)*$`

#### Fixed Unsafe Temporary Directory Cleanup
- **File**: `lib/common.sh`
- **Impact**: CRITICAL - Prevented interference with concurrent installations
- **Changes**:
  - Replaced dangerous global cleanup with process-specific temporary directories
  - Removed time-based file deletion that could affect concurrent installations
  - Added `SBX_TMP_DIR` variable for isolated temp directory management
  - Implemented safe path validation before cleanup
- **Details**: Each installation now uses its own isolated temp directory with secure permissions (700)

#### Fixed Port Allocation Race Condition
- **File**: `lib/network.sh`
- **Impact**: CRITICAL - Enhanced concurrent installation safety (partial fix)
- **Changes**:
  - Improved port allocation locking mechanism with file-based locks
  - Added retry logic with 2-second intervals (3 attempts)
  - Implemented `/dev/tcp` validation within lock to prevent race conditions
- **Note**: Full fix (holding lock until service startup) deferred to future release due to complexity

### üõ°Ô∏è Security Enhancements (HIGH)

#### Strengthened Backup Encryption
- **File**: `lib/backup.sh`
- **Impact**: HIGH - Improved encryption strength from ~192 to full 256-bit entropy
- **Changes**:
  - Increased password generation from `openssl rand -base64 32` to `-base64 48 | head -c 64`
  - Added password strength validation (minimum 32 characters)
  - Enhanced entropy for AES-256-CBC encryption
- **Technical**: Now generates 384 bits of random data, ensuring full 256-bit key strength

#### Enhanced Backup Restoration Validation
- **File**: `lib/backup.sh`
- **Impact**: HIGH - Improved restore reliability and security
- **Changes**:
  - Relaxed date format validation to support timezone variations: `^sbx-backup-[0-9]{8}-[0-9]{6}[a-zA-Z0-9._-]*$`
  - Added tar archive integrity validation before extraction
  - Implemented comprehensive error messages for validation failures
- **Security**: Maintains path traversal protection while allowing legitimate backup formats

#### Improved Certificate Validation Logic
- **File**: `lib/validation.sh`
- **Impact**: HIGH - More robust certificate-key pair validation
- **Changes**:
  - Simplified validation flow with step-by-step error checking
  - Replaced fallback logic with generic `openssl pkey` command (supports RSA, EC, Ed25519)
  - Added detailed error messages with file paths and suggestions
  - Documented empty MD5 hash constant (`d41d8cd98f00b204e9800998ecf8427e`)
  - Changed expiration check to 30-day warning (instead of immediate expiration)
- **Technical**: Uses unified public key extraction avoiding type-specific commands

#### Optimized Service Startup Verification
- **File**: `lib/service.sh`
- **Impact**: HIGH - Eliminated race conditions in service startup
- **Changes**:
  - Replaced fixed 3-second delay with intelligent polling (up to 10 seconds)
  - Implemented exponential backoff with 1-second intervals
  - Added startup time reporting in success message
  - Improved error messages with automatic log display on failure
- **Performance**: Typically completes in 2-4 seconds on normal systems, waits up to 10s on slow systems

### üßπ Code Quality Improvements

#### Extracted Magic Numbers to Constants
- **File**: `lib/common.sh`
- **Impact**: MEDIUM - Improved code maintainability
- **New Constants**:
  ```bash
  NETWORK_TIMEOUT_SEC=5
  SERVICE_STARTUP_MAX_WAIT_SEC=10
  SERVICE_PORT_VALIDATION_MAX_RETRIES=5
  PORT_ALLOCATION_MAX_RETRIES=3
  PORT_ALLOCATION_RETRY_DELAY_SEC=2
  CLEANUP_OLD_FILES_MIN=60
  BACKUP_RETENTION_DAYS=30
  CADDY_CERT_WAIT_TIMEOUT_SEC=60
  ```

#### Removed Dead Code
- **Files**: `lib/validation.sh`, `lib/network.sh`, `lib/config.sh`
- **Removed Functions**:
  - `validate_system_requirements()` - Never called, removed from `lib/validation.sh:320-351`
  - `validate_reality_dest()` - Failures ignored, removed from `lib/network.sh:215-240`
  - Removed corresponding function call in `lib/config.sh:348-351`

#### Cleaned Up Commented Code
- **Files**: `lib/service.sh`, `lib/backup.sh`
- **Removed**:
  - Non-root user capabilities configuration (incomplete feature)
  - Clipboard functionality (rarely useful on headless servers)
  - Lines removed: `lib/service.sh:33-35`, `lib/backup.sh:127-143`

### üìä Testing & Validation

#### ShellCheck Compliance
- **Status**: ‚úÖ All files pass with no errors
- **Results**: Only style suggestions (SC2250), no functional issues
- **Files Validated**: `lib/{common,network,validation,service,backup,caddy,config}.sh`

### üîÑ Breaking Changes

**None** - All changes maintain backward compatibility with existing installations.
